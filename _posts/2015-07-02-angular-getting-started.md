For the past two years I've been working on web applications primarily developed using the javascript framework AngularJS. At the beginning I was pretty skeptic about switching from my comfort zone's JQuery or [Vanilla.js](http://vanilla-js.com/), even more when I was attacked by all these new terms like *promises*, *services*, *modules*. After some reading, watching video tutorials, and practice I've learned quite a bit about the framework. I'm still not an *expert* on the subject but I've learned enough to be able to develop fully functional single-page web applications and sometimes the [AngularJS Official Documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api) isn't just quite enough. So here are the resources I've found the most useful while building my skills.

## Learning AngularJS
First things first. Some people say that learning AngularJS will be easier when the acclaimed [version 2.0](https://angular.io/) reaches a stable release. I haven't got my hands into version 2.0 since I prefer waiting until the stable version is launched. In my opinion though, with the addition of the "controllerAs" syntax, and even TypeScript (which I have been using lately and hope to post a couple of tutorials in the future) Angular not only has become a very popular framework, but also a relatively *easy* to learn.

On my way to becoming a better Angular developer I've mainly followed two developers which can provide you with tutorials, styleguides, and helpful articles that should get you up and running quickly. These two are: [Todd Motto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto) and [John Papa](https://twitter.com/John_Papa).

#Getting Started
As much as I'd love to try and compile all my knowledge into a tutorial, I'm pretty sure it won't be as complete, polished and in-depth as [this tutorial](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/angularjs-tutorial). It covers everything from the initial architecture concepts, explains the core modules and even how to develop your own costume ones.

#Styleguides
I still haven't been able to fully fall for an specific coding styleguide but [John Papa's](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) has been my main reference when developing. At first I learned from this guide by following his [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) tutorials, this helped me turn my *spaghetti* code into much more readable, testable, and modular *ravioli* code.

#Other useful links
**Promises** were one of the concepts that took me quite a while to understand. Luckily a talented developer managed to [explain them](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html) using cartoons.
